Nice to meet you! I'm currently working at GitHub as a software engineer. I recently graduated from the Bachelors Of Technology program in Spring 2022. I've previously worked on building the Cion Labs Network as a fullstack developer, Cion's Experimentation Platform as a data developer, Cion Checkout as a backend developer, and Cion's Caching Platform as a production engineer.
